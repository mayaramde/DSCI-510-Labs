    "Hey Everyone, \n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines for the Lab:\n",
    "- Download the lab materials from D2L. You're supposed to complete it by the deadline, Friday 11:59pm PDT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to complete the assignments individually. If you are having trouble completing the assignment do let the TA's/CP's or Graders know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please don't copy code (either partially/fully) from your classmates. Plagiarism of any form will result in a 0 and you will be reported to SJACS (https://sjacs.usc.edu/students/academic-integrity/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill the code in this notebook and upload it for submission. While doing this, make sure all supporting files that you download from D2L are in the same directory as this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please don't submit code in text files and .py files. Also no mailing code to the TA's or Graders. There were exemptions provided to students in Lab-1 due to D2L issues, environment setup and course registrations but these exemptions will not be carried over to future labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- File Naming Convention : Lab3_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "- A lot of students haven't followed the naming conventions in Lab-1 but were exempted (This may incur penalties in future labs btw)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't change existing methods (if any, unless otherwise mentioned in the instructions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please Don't ask for changes to the Grading Rubrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are encouraged to look up resources online like python docs and stackoverflow. But, you are encouraged to look up the topics and not the questions themselves  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your last submission before the deadline will be counted towards your grade. You can submit any number of times before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores are capped at 10 points including the Bonus problem. For Example : Even if you get a score of 15/10, your score is capped at 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus score is counted only if the first 2 questions are attempted. Don't attempt the bonus question if you haven't attempted the first 2"
