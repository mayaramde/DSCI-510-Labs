    "Lab 6 (Week-6)\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "Hey Everyone, \n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines for the Lab:\n",
    "- Download the lab materials from D2L. You're supposed to complete it by the deadline, Friday 11:59pm PDT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to complete the assignments individually. If you are having trouble completing the assignment do let the TA's/CP's or Graders know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please don't copy code (either partially/fully) from your classmates. Plagiarism of any form will result in a 0 and you will be reported to SJACS (https://sjacs.usc.edu/students/academic-integrity/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill the code in this notebook and upload it for submission. While doing this, make sure all supporting files that you download from D2L are in the same directory as this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please don't submit code in text files and .py files. Also no mailing code to the TA's or Graders. There were exemptions provided to students in earlier labs due to D2L issues, environment setup and course registrations but these exemptions will not be carried over to future labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- File Naming Convention : Lab6_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.ipynb (Failure to comply to this policy may incur penalties )\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't change existing methods (if any, unless otherwise mentioned in the instructions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are encouraged to look up resources online like python docs and stackoverflow. But, you are encouraged to look up the topics and not the questions themselves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your last submission before the deadline will be counted towards your grade. You can submit any number of times before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores are capped at 10 points including the Bonus problem. For Example : Even if you get a score of 12/10, your score is capped at 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your output should be as mentioned in the question (Don't output/print extra items which are not asked in the question as it makes it difficult for the graders to grade). (Failure to comply to this policy may incur penalties)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to take input from file/console only if it is mentioned in the question. If not we need just the logic/implementation of your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please Don't ask for changes to the Grading Rubrics. Some questions have all/nothing rubric and missing one test case/ edge case may result in a 0 score. So you are encouraged to write your own test cases and evaluate your code as and where necessary. The TA's or Graders will not be providing you with the test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "- For this lab on a non-precedential basis, the bonus question can be attempted independent of attempting the other questions. A few students who have no prior programming background feel that the Labs in general are a bit on the harder side, so this lab has reduced difficulty level. Additionally, to make it further easier to score, we have MCQ's as the bonus questions. Hopefully, you have a great time working with this assignment and getting started with Object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make coding easier, a lot of the boilerplate code has been given as a template to show you first hand how OOPs constructs are designed. Please use them as references.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't change the existing boilerplate code. The reason the boilerplate code has been given, is to make it easy for you to see the bigger picture and get you up to speed faster. There have been multiple comments added, to make it easier for students to logically comprehend the sequence of steps."
